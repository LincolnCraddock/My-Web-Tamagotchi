# My Web Tamagotchi
Take good care of little, digital pets and keep them happy.

## Project Requirements
### Required features
1. Each tamagotchi is loaded from a JSON document and displayed on the main page.
2. Each tamagotchi has a few buttons you can press to take care of it.
3. Clicking each tamagotchi's buttons changes their state.
4. You can enter `Ctrl+D` on your keyboard to show/hide the status of your tamagotchi.

### 10-point features
- Tamagotchi display their names, and can be renamed.
- Each tamagotchi's hunger, energy, and happiness change over time, and can be incremented/decremented with certain button pressed.
- Load tamagotchi using fetch from a web server.
- Display small thumbnail animations of tamagotchi you can play with.

### Other cool features
- All information about each tamagotchi is stored in a JSON file, including their animations, how quickly they gain hunger, their name, and what their buttons do.
- New and completely unique tamagotchi could be created without changing the code, because their JSON and images are loaded from a separate server (my GitHub Pages website).
- React Router is used to serve different webpages, including the tamagotchi select menu and each tamagotchi's webpage.
